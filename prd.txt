# Product Requirements Document: Engineering Librarian

## Executive Summary

The Engineering Librarian is an AI-powered knowledge management system that transforms static technical documentation into an intelligent, conversational database. Users can interact with their engineering knowledge base through natural language queries while maintaining visibility into how the system processes, organizes, and evolves their information.

## Problem Statement

Engineering teams accumulate vast amounts of technical documentation across multiple formats (PDFs, spreadsheets, Word documents, etc.) that become difficult to search, synthesize, and maintain. Traditional document management systems require exact keyword matches and don't understand context or relationships between concepts. Engineers waste significant time hunting through documents for information that could be instantly accessible through intelligent querying.

## Vision

Create a "living database" where engineering knowledge is accessible through natural conversation, automatically organized by AI, and continuously monitored for gaps, usage patterns, and optimization opportunities.

## Target Users

**Primary**: Individual engineers and small engineering teams (2-10 people)
**Secondary**: Engineering managers seeking insights into team knowledge usage patterns

## Core User Stories

### As an Engineer, I want to:
- Upload technical documents in various formats and have them automatically processed
- Ask natural language questions about my technical knowledge base
- Get responses with source citations and relevant context
- Switch between cloud-based and local AI models based on privacy needs
- View how my knowledge base is being utilized and maintained

### As a Team Lead, I want to:
- Monitor which topics are frequently queried vs. underutilized
- Identify knowledge gaps in our documentation
- Track the health and growth of our knowledge base
- Understand how team members interact with technical information
